# payload
The payload repo contains the following directories:

## orbiter_simulation
Rough simulator of orbits in python3. \
This could be useful for understanding the motion of the satellite around Earth. 

## payload-software
Code for an STM32 to do image capture, compression, brightness optimization, etc. \
This will be useful reference material for the code we make 2nd semester (or it might
just have everything we need).

## telescope-simulator
MATLAB code to simulate several lens setups using the Optometrika package. \
These scripts will be useful reference material for simulating our lens setup.
